# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
The previous analysis compared total rides vs city types and percentage fare vs city types. Also, number of drivers, number of rides and average fare per city, e.t.c. These gave a clear picture of the volume of pyber rides in diffrent city types in 2019 and the percentage fare from each city type within the same year. 

The new analysis focuses on a shorter time frame, between January to April, 2019, and it is designed to compare the tatal weekly fares for each city type within this period. We analyze the toatl rides, number of drivers, total fare, average fare per ride and average fare per driver for all three city types. The we created a line graph to show the relationship between the total weekly fares for each city type. 

The main task is to summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used to make key decisions at PyBer. 

### Results

##### Data Summary

From the dataframe link above, the Urban city type had the highest number of total rides, drivers and fares followed by the Suburban and then the rural city type. The Rural cities had ethe highest average fare per ride and per driver, followed by the Suburban and then the Urban. This means that, on the average, PyBer rides cost more in the rural cities and drivers in these cities earn more. The comapny makes more money per rider in the rural cities. Additionally, there's more total revenue generation in the Urban cities because they have the most rides and the highest number of drivers, hence a much higher total fare generated.

The chart compares the fares generated per week in the different city types over a specific period of time; January through April. It is clear from the chart in the above that the Urban city type had the highest total fare per week for every week, and there was an overall upward trend over this time period. The Suburban city type came in second in the rankings and the Rural city type had the least fares for this period. There was a spike for all the city types in the third week of Februrary. The month of April saw a decline for both the Rural and Urban city types, however, there was a sharp growth for the Suburban city type. At the end of this time period, overall growth for the Rural city type was the lowest. 

### Summary
##### Business Recommendations 
Implement the 80/20 rule. Channel the most resources to the city type that generates the most revenue and has the most potential for growth i:e the Urban city type. 

Employ more drivers in the Rural cities so that there are more available rides for potential riders in those cities. 

Take a closer look at the possible cause of the growth spike around the third week of Feb. If it was an advert or a promo or an event, it will be a good idea to replicate that event for all city types.
